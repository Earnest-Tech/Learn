<br>Our Coaching Services

<br>“How does coaching work?”
<br>
<br>“What is the difference between coaching and therapy?” 
<br>
<br>“How do I tell a qualified life coach from an unqualified one?”
<br>
<br>“What kinds of things can coaching help me with?”
<br>
<br>“How much does coaching cost?”
<br>
<br>“Does insurance cover coaching?”

Evidence-based approaches are those that have been found by research to be genuinely effective in helping you create real and lasting change. Unless therapy or coaching is grounded in these evidence-based approaches, it can feel wishy-washy and ineffective.

<br>
<br>Creating real and lasting change in the most important parts of your life, like yourself, your relationship and your career is not an “event” but rather a growth process that begins when you enter into a relationship with an expert therapist or coach who can help you understand yourself, grow as a person, and learn new skills and strategies that enable you to create positive change. This is a growth process that occurs over time, step-by-step.
<br>
<br>Because you’ll be working closely with your therapist or coach for a period of time it’s important that you feel good about who you are working with. That’s why we offer a free consultation meeting so that you can get to know them and discuss your hopes and goals to ensure it’s a good fit before moving forward.
<br>
<br>If you would like to bypass the consultation session and jump right in, you can schedule a solution session instead.</p>

Our clients work with us to achieve personal growth, healthy relationships, self improvement and professional success through positive, effective counseling and coaching.
<br>
<br>In contrast, health insurance covers “behavioral healthcare that is medically necessary treatment for a psychiatric condition.” Here at Growing Self, we do not specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions. Therefore, many of our core services are not considered “medically necessary treatments,” but rather what proactive people who are on a path of self-actualization and life satisfaction do to achieve their most precious goals. If that’s what you’re looking for, you are in the right place.
<br>
<br>That said, under certain circumstances, we may be able to help you submit claims to your health insurance company if your work with us meets some specific criteria. Learn more about all of your affordable options, see the rates of the different providers on our team,  and learn whether we can help you use your insurance benefits on our  Rates and Insurance page.</p>

<br>About Consultation Sessions
<br>
<br>Because getting involved with a therapist or coach is such an important, potentially long-term relationship, we offer a Free Consultation, which is an opportunity to meet with the counselor or coach of your choice to talk about your hopes and goals, learn about them, and make sure it’s a good fit before moving forward with multi-session, private counseling or coaching.
<br>
<br>Schedule Your Free Consultation Session
<br>About Solution Sessions
<br>
<br>If you are looking to either bypass the consultation and jump right into the work, OR if you’d like to simply meet for a one-time coaching session to talk about a specific issue and get some direction you can schedule a Solution Session instead.
<br>
<br>A Solution Session is a forty-five minute coaching session where you can talk at length about what’s been going on, and get our recommendations about specific things that will move you forward. You’ll leave with a written plan of action and no strings attached. (Although you can certainly meet with your coach again, if you’d like to.) We charge $95 for this service.

<br>
<br>This involves having an authentic relationship with a therapist or coach who can see you and hear you so that they can truly know you, understand you, and help you. Meeting face-to-face online allows your coach to read your body language, or see the fleeting expression on your face after they ask a challenging question, or notice if you’re experiencing a big emotion. That’s why your work with us is transformation: We go deeper.
<br>
<br>If we work together, you’ll be having a real relationship with a real coach or therapist who is invested in you.
<br>
<br>We don’t do “cookie cutter” because you’re not a cookie. You won’t get cliché advice or canned responses from us.   Instead, you’ll get the full attention of a highly trained, smart, caring expert who knows YOU.
<br>
<br>You’re an individual with a one-of-a-kind life. We offer you a true growth experience, and that means we both need to show up in an authentic way.
<br>
<br>We’re ready to do that, with you.</p>

<br>Simply click on that link at the time of your call, and you’ll be connected. If you are doing couples coaching with a long-distance partner, forward them the confirmation email so they have the link too.

<br>If you haven’t used Zoom before, please watch this short (60 second) video for a brief overview of how to use it to ensure you’re ready for that first call: Click to Watch Tip: Please allow Zoom access to your device’s camera and microphone so that we can see and hear you!
<br>
<br>If you scheduled an in-person meeting and would like to meet by Zoom (or phone) instead, that is perfectly fine. Simply reply to your confirmation email letting your expert know. They’ll get the message and send you their Zoom link.</p>
